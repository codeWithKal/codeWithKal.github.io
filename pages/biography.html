            <strong>My AutoBiography</strong>
            <p class="biography">I was born in a small village called <em>Aleltu</em> which is 55 km from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. My father's name is Shiferaw Girma and my Mother's name is Tsige Demissie. They're both supporting for me. I have four lovely siblings of which three of them are my sisters and one of them is my little brother. I do love them so much.
                <br>
                when my age reaches to go to school, I joined one of the village schools found nearby. I was too lazy to know what I was supposed to know at my level and soon after I enrolled in one of the private schools in our village. That's where my academic growth and self-progres began. <em>Jitu Academy</em> was the place where I've deep rooted my dedication to learning.
                <br>
                I then moved to <em>sendafa</em> to proceed with my 3rd grade education. I learned there till I reach to 6th grade and moved on back to Aleltu on 7th grade. I then completed the two years remaining there in Aleltu Primary school and took my regional grade eighth exam. I directly promoted to Aleltu Secondary School with Good grade and begun pursuing my highschool academic carrer there.
                <br>
                Aleltu Secondary school was one of the finest places in my academic life. I developed an outstanding performance and compitant behaviour with my classmates. I took my national EGSECE in 2017 and promoted with greate distinction.
                <br>
                It didn't take that much time to finish the 2 years of senior secondary school duration. I sat for Ethiopian University Joining Exam in 2019 and could be able to pass with Greate result. I had been a top scorer of my batch and joined Addis Ababa University then after.
                <br>
                Addis Ababa University was the first big eduacational institution I could join for the first time. Eventhough I was new, It didn't take me a while to familiarize my self with the college community and I soon be able to involve in daily and my academic routine.
